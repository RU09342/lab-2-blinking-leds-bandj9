# Button Blink

## Project Description
In this lab the output pin is enabled as well as an internal resistor which connects to either Vcc or ground.  An input also has to be set. A while loop is created which states if the button is pressed then the output pin is set to 0.  The input pin is toggled when the button that is hooked up to it is pressed.
